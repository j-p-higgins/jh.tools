**Mangle**<br>
A trio of distortions varying from gentle thickening to full sonic destruction. A multiband overdrive style distortion, a hard clipping distortion with control of the symmetry of the clipping and a '1-bit ADC' for turning all sounds into square waves.

**ResonantDownsample**<br>
Sample and hold being abused with a feedback loop so that it works like a weird resonant filter. Switchable anti-aliasing type filtering to reduce high frequency artifacts for a more subtle effect. Warning, can self oscillate which can be very loud.

**L80sReverb**<br>
Relatively rubbish reverb that sounds like a cheap, reverb unit from the late 80s. Where this plugin is interesting is that you can modify the block size, overlap and sample rate of the reverb processing which gives effects similar to circuit bent reverb units.

**Gloop**<br>
Dual mono looper/freeze effect with tremolo. No zero crossing point detection so often clicks and pops. Switch on random for instant Alva Noto.

Esoteric VST plugins made in Puredata compiled with Camomile (https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile).

ResonantDownsample:
Sample and hold being abused with a feedback loop so that it works like really weird resonant low pass filter. Switchable anti-aliasing type filtering to reduce high frequency artifacts for a more subtle effect. Warning, can self oscillate which can be very loud.

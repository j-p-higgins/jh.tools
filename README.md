**ResonantDownsample**<br>
Sample and hold being abused with a feedback loop so that it works like a weird resonant filter. Switchable anti-aliasing type filtering to reduce high frequency artifacts for a more subtle effect. Warning, can self oscillate which can be very loud.

**L80sReverb**<br>
Relatively rubbish reverb that sounds a bit like a cheap, reverb unit from the late 80s. Where this plugin is interesting is that you can modify the block size, overlap and sample rate of the reverb processing which gives effects similar to circuit bent reverb units.
